I'll just start off by saying how much I love the game. Keep up the amazing work. Im a fan for life. With that being said, i keep running into this "thing" now. I don't know if it's an issue or if im pressing something by accident. Basically, ill be playing the game and at random, the screen will freeze/lock and open up this grid ive never seen before(check screenshot). At that point, none of the buttons work. Only the in-game menu works. So i used it. Exited the current map, reloaded, and about 2 minutes later happens again. Restart game, same issue. Restart PC, same issue. I saw some answers about my C drive going to sleep, but those issues didnt seem to have the grid problem. If you guys can help me out on this i would really appreciate it! I need the "Lazy Bastard" achievement!!!! PS: If there is any other info you need, let me know i will get it to you guys asap! PS: Make a mobile FACTORIO!!!!!! Jk you guys rock, you do what you want.
